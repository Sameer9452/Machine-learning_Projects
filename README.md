# Machine-learning_Projects
In this Car_Price _Prediction project ,I had done the following,

1- Data understanding and exploration
2- Data cleaning
3- Data preparation: Feature Engineering and Scaling
4- Feature Selection using RFE and Model Building
5- Linear Regression Assumptions Validation and Outlier Removal
6- Rebuilding the Model Post Outlier Removal: Feature Selection using K-Fold Cross Validation & RFE
7- Removing Multicollinearity, Model Re-evaluation and Assumptions Validation

to predict the Car price,have a look at it.
