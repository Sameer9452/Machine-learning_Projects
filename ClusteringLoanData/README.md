## Introduction

Clustering is a popular technique in machine learning used for grouping similar data points together. In this project, we apply KMeans clustering algorithm to a loan dataset to identify potential patterns and groups within the data. This can be useful for various purposes such as customer segmentation, risk assessment, and targeted marketing strategies.


## Usage

1. Place your loan dataset in CSV format inside the `loan` directory.
2. Open and run the `ClusteringLoanData_ML-Project.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment or any Python IDE of your choice.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to perform the following tasks:
    - Load the dataset.
    - Preprocess the data (if necessary).
    - Visualize the data.
    - Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method.
    - Apply KMeans clustering algorithm.
    - Analyze and interpret the results.
